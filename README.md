# SteamAccountSwitcher 

A fast C# approach to a [Steam Account Switcher](https://github.com/itsjfx/steam-account-switcher) that doesn't use Python and can be ran on Windows natively.

## Download
Download one of the Windows Executables from the [Releases here](https://github.com/Codingale/SteamAccountSwitcher/releases).

## PRs
I'll accept pull requests that follow the following rules:
- PRs must stay localized to one feature or fix. (unless it's solving many related bugs)
- Prefer readability over performance.
- Don't change formatting from the default VS style. (If in doubt `Control+K D` should format it to conform)

## Why?
I didn't like having to download Python and use a command line switch accounts when I could just write a app to do it without python.
