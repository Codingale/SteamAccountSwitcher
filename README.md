## PRs
I'll accept pull requests that follow the following rules:
- PRs must stay localized to one feature or fix. (unless it's solving many related bugs)
- Prefer readability over performance.
- Don't change formatting from the default VS style. (If in doubt `Control+K D` should format it to conform)
