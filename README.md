When I first made this tool, it was super useful but as Steam has evolved over time, and now has a native feature to switch users easily thanks to the SteamDeck. This repo isn't needed anymore, me and my friends have long been using that feature, the code is still up and I welcome you to fork it and improve it, it was really only meant as a hack since Steam was lacking a feature to swap accounts easily.

# SteamAccountSwitcher
A fast C# approach to a [Steam Account Switcher](https://github.com/itsjfx/steam-account-switcher) that doesn't use Python and can be ran on Windows natively.

## Download
Download one of the Windows Executables from the [Releases here](https://github.com/Codingale/SteamAccountSwitcher/releases).

## PRs
I'll accept pull requests that follow the following rules:
- PRs must stay localized to one feature or fix. (unless it's solving many related bugs)
- Prefer readability over performance.
- Don't change formatting from the default VS style. (If in doubt `Control+K D` should format it to conform)

## Why?
I didn't like having to download Python and use a command line switch accounts when I could just write a app to do it without python.
