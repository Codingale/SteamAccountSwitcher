## Code guidelines

* One per-major change, or fixes. 
  * Please don't mix fixes and new features in the same PR.
* Make sure it's styled for readablity but also preformence.
  * We aim to keep 2x to 3x faster than AHK or Python implementations.
* We target Windows first and fore-most 
  * Most steam users are on Windows (as of 2019) so we want to support Windows more.
* Secuirty over anything else.
  * Most users realise that applications could leak their passwords remotely we want to make sure they're aware we're not transfering any data over the network (automatic updates etc)
* Useablity and accessablity, we want to support people with vision issues to be able to game and new features must consider said people.
  * No tiny text, or breaking DPI scaling, configuration for colors.
