## Code guidelines

* One per-major change, or fixes.
* Please don't mix fixes and new features in the same PR.
* Make sure it's styled for readability but also performance.
* We aim to keep 2x to 3x faster than AHK or Python implementations.
* We target Windows first and fore-most
* Most steam users are on Windows (as of 2019) so we want to support Windows more.
* Security over anything else.
* Most users realize that applications could leak their passwords remotely we want to make sure they're aware we're not transferring any data over the network (automatic updates etc)
* Usability and accessibility, we want to support people with vision issues to be able to game and new features must consider said people.
* No tiny text, or breaking DPI scaling, configuration for colors.
